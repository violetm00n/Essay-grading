This project that I've done during my 24 hour hackaton is about
Essay grading using machine learning algorithms offers a practical solution to
automate and streamline the assessment process. By leveraging techniques such as SVM,
Random Forest, and XGBoost, along with a carefully curated dataset and a user-friendly web
interface developed using Streamlit, educators can efficiently evaluate essays while saving time
and resources. Further research may focus on fine-tuning the models, incorporating additional
features, and enhancing the user experience of the web application.
